# prostT5 + CLIP

Combining Protein and LLM Embeddings with CLIP for Protein Design and Function Prediction

Protein design and function prediction are crucial tasks in computational biology with significant implications for drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and protein understanding. Recent advancements in protein language models (pLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in capturing intricate patterns in protein sequences and their associated textual descriptions.

This project explores the potential of combining protein embeddings from pLMs (specifically ProtT5) with text embeddings from LLMs (using Microsoftâ€™s Phi-3.5 model) in a unified framework inspired by CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training).

While CLIP was originally designed to align image and text embeddings, we propose adapting this approach to create a shared embedding space for protein sequences and their textual descriptions.

The ultimate goals of this project are twofold: 1. Protein Design: Infer protein sequences from textual descriptions of their properties or functions. 2. Function Prediction: Predict protein descriptions from a given sequences.

By leveraging the strengths of both protein and language models, we aim to develop a powerful tool for bidirectional protein-text understanding and generation.
